# sp2graph #

The goal of sp2praph project is to provide tools for analysing the bond-order of sp2 carbon nanostructures.

## Objectives ##
Given a planar carbon-based structure (sp2 hydridized), sp2graph aims to provide:

   - all possible Kekul√© representations
   - the most stable structure according to Clar's sextet theory
   - allow for user defined constrains, such as to impose single or double bonds at specified connections and/or radicals

## Methodology ##



## Dependencies ##
Before installation of Inelastica the following packages are required
   - numpy

## Installation ##
Manual installation of  is performed with the command

    python setup.py install --prefix=<prefix>
    # or
    python setup.py install --home=<my-python-home>

One may also wish to set the following environment variables

    export PYTHONPATH=<my-python-home>/lib/<python-version>/site-packages
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<my-python-home>/lib
