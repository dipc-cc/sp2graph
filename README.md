The goal of _sp2graph_ project is to provide tools for analyzing the bond-order of sp2-hybridized carbon nanostructures. This is particular interesting for the interpretation of recent experiments performed with scanning tunneling microscopy on graphene-based nanostructures synthesized on metallic surfaces.

## Objectives ##
Given the `xyz` geometry of a planar carbon-based structure (sp2 hybridized), _sp2graph_ aims to provide:

   - all possible Kekul√© representations
   - the most stable structure according to Clar's sextet theory
   - allow for user defined constrains, such as to impose single or double bonds at specified connections and/or radicals
   - estimation of the most stable structure through first-neighbors tight-binding model

## Methodology ##


## Installation ##
For _sp2graph_ installation the following packages are required:

   - numpy

Manual installation of  is performed with the command:

    python setup.py install --prefix=<prefix>
    # or
    python setup.py install --home=<my-python-home>

One may also wish to set the following environment variables:

    export PYTHONPATH=<my-python-home>/lib/<python-version>/site-packages
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<my-python-home>/lib
